### The WiiScale CSV Save To File App

#### Original Description
WiiScale is a little Mac app (OS X 10.6+) that connects to your Wii Balance Board over Bluetooth and records your weight. This is a lot quicker then using something like the WiiFit game in which many steps are involved to do a simple weigh-in.

##Original credit for this app goes to [@Dmitri Amariei](https://github.com/damariei)

This app can optionally save your data to a CSV file on your desktop.

#### Project Goals
- Allow quick and easy weigh-ins
- Save data to a CSV file


#### Future Goals
- Connect to different online services
- Various UX fixes
- Smooth out pairing sequence
