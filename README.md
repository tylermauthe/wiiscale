### The WiiScale CSV Save To File App

#### Original Description
WiiScale is a Mac app (OS X 10.6+) that connects to your Wii Balance Board (via Bluetooth). The app uses the Balance Board to acquire your weight!

This is a lot quicker then using something like the WiiFit game in which many steps are involved to do a simple weigh-in.

This app can optionally save your data to a CSV file on your desktop. You can import the CSV into an Excel sheet for tracking purposes!

#### Project Goals
- Allow quick and easy weigh-ins
- Save data to a CSV file

#### Future Goals
- Connect to different online services
- Other calculations (BMI, etc)
- Better Calibration / Taring
- Various UX fixes..
- Smooth out pairing sequence (if possible)
